# Hi, I'm Anders 👋
### From Top Sales to .NET Developer

I am 46 years old and currently reinventing myself. After 25 years in sales (Lokaldelen, Hitta.se, UPS, Dina Försäkringar), I realized that my discipline and drive could build something more permanent than just the next deal. I am now channeling that energy into C# and .NET.

**My Philosophy:**
> "You don't have to be born a programmer. You become one through discipline and patience."

**Current Focus:**
* 🏗️ **Architecture:** Learning Layered Architecture, Repository Pattern & Dependency Injection.
* 💻 **C# & .NET:** Building a console-based ERP system (moving to Web API soon).
* 📚 **Education:** Studying .NET Development in Gävle (Class of '25).
